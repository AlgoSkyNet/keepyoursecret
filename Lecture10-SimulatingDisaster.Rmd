#### Lecture 10 Simulating Disaster (Understanding Risks of loosing information)

Hello and welcome back to the course Keep Your Secret under Your Control. I do hope that you are learning new things and enjoying fantastic manipulations happenning with your data. Additionally you are able to exactly follow steps that are happening during manipulations in R. In my personal view the only reason you want to know these details is because you don't want to get into the situation that you doing something wrong... for this I thought to prepare for you a special lecture that will help you to experience situations that you doing something wrong. Making mistakes and then realise that something is wrong... upps. This is why I thought it will be better to simulate the disaster and prevent them accordinly...

We will review following situations that can lead to disaster and think about possible strategies on how to prevent the disasters...

I will group these disasters into 2 categories: 

##### Not possible to De-Crypt Information

* Encrypting with Public Key, deleting Information, not having corresponding Private Key...
* Loosing encrypted information or Private Key
* Forgetting passphrase to your Private Key file

##### Keys becoming public...

* Submitting your private key or passphrases to public repository
* Loosing control on USB keys or computers with Private Key

Please feel free to suggest other risks you think of either in question board of the course or by sending private message...






Now it's time for me to thank you for reaching this far in the course. I would love to see you joining in to the further chapter of the course which will be the case studies where we will be discussing various practical situations of using our new CRYPTOGRAPHY expertise!!!
