#### Lecture 16 Keep Common Secret in Public Version Control

Hello and welcome back to the course Keep Your secret under your control. In this lecture we will cover simple idea of keeping encrypted information in the Public Git Hub Repository. 

Our goal will be to see how to use package 'secret' in R to keep part of R project encrypted.

```{r}
library(secret)
```

Authors of this package are Gábor Csárdi and Andrie de Vries.



What I would do now is to create a folder on my Desktop in Mac. This folder will be named '00_RSA'. This folder will contain my passwords, R scripts and executable files. Like in the previous lecture we can encrypt and decrypt our passwords within seconds.

Same idea: fit in the usb key containing Private Key, press one button and get our passwords decrypted. We can then open the file with passwords, check it, close it. Once done we can encrypt our file back by pressing the script Encrypt.sh

This lecture will be about to know how to execute our R scripts from Mac 

On Mac executable files are also named 'shell' scripts. It is a kind of a way to get more direct assess to the Operating System and programs installed on it. To try it out you can open 'Terminal' on your Mac. You can practice to execute some code there.

For example, let's use Termanal to find out where our Rscript program is installed.  You can type 

```{bash}
which Rscript
```

in my case, the path of our Rscript program is: **/usr/local/bin/Rscript**

We can simply write in our Terminal this path and provide as an argument the name of our R script to run...

Our next goal will be to adapt scripts we had before to run on Mac... You can find these scripts in the repository for this lecture.

The whole idea will be to replace the paths we have to the ones we have on Mac. I will insert my USB key with a **Private.key**. I will then need to find the path of my **private.key**. It's a bit of a cumbersome in Mac. Select the file you want the path and press **CMD+i**. This will bring you the info window. There, find 'where' clause and select the path. Once done press **CMD+c**. You can now paste this path with **CMD+v**. It is **/Volumes/PRIVATE/private.key**. We will then need to use this address in our R Script. 

Finally I have modified scripts EncryptM.R and DecryptM.R. You will find that I have defined paths to the private, public keys, passwords in clear text and encrypted form. The rest of code is exact same as in previous lecture.

Final goal will be to learn how to execute our shell script by doubleclicking on it.

Execute this command on Terminal:

```{bash}
chmod a+x /Users/Slava1/Desktop/00_RSA/_Encrypt.sh
```

Then right click and select Open With... click on 'Always open with' select Enable 'All Applications'. Find 'Utilities', Terminal and click open...

You can see that script will be executed...

To summarise, in this lecture we have achieved the functionality to encrypt, decrypt our passwords by clicking on the shell script. We got to know how to find path of files in Mac and how to execute R scipts from Shell Scripts...

I hope that you have learnt something new and useful. We have few more concepts to cover. Next one will be about to keep encrypted dataset submitted in the Version Control and available for several collaborators...
