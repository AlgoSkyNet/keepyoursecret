#### Lecture 16 Keep Common Secret in Public Version Control

Hello and welcome back to the course Keep Your secret under your control. In this lecture we will cover simple idea of keeping encrypted information in the Public Git Hub Repository. Even further you will see how easy it is to keep common secret (user credentials) easily available for you and your collaborators

Our goal will be to see how to use package 'secret' in R to keep part of R project encrypted.

Our scenario for this lecture will be to:

* loading package 'secret'
* create vault
* add users to the vault
* add secret to the vault
* get the secret from the vault
* updating the secret in the vault
* adding users to access the secret...
* getting secret by collaborators
* adding another secret to the vault
* removing users from accessing secrets
* deleting the secrets...

##### Learn 'secret' package for your own secrets in Version Control

We will start by loading package secret

```{r}
# if necessary install.packages("secret") or from github devtools::install_github('secret')
library(secret)
```

// Authors: "Gábor Csárdi and Andrie de Vries".

This package uses openssl library and it's very useful to collaborate and keep common secrets in Public Repositories directly via Version Control. It is kind of amazing thing because you have your passwords encrypted directly in your R project.

##### vault

A vault is a folder that will contain public keys of the users... you can easily create that in your R project file by executing command

```{r}
# create vault
if(!dir.exists("COMMON_SECRETS")){
create_vault("COMMON_SECRETS")}
```

Feel free to open folder... as you will notice package will automatically add sub-folders

##### add users

Now we will add users to the vault. At first I will be using my public key stored in my USB key

```{r}
# adding user to the vault
add_user(email = "vz",
         public_key = file.path("/Volumes/PRIVATE/public.key"),
         vault = "COMMON_SECRETS")
```

What is happenning now is that function is now adding 'public' key to the folder users

##### add secrets

The next step for me will be to add a secret to our vault. In this case I will use my csv file 'passwords.csv'. 

```{r}
# adding a secret
secret <- read_csv("passwords.csv")

add_secret(name = "secret", 
           value = secret,
           users = "vz",
           vault = "COMMON_SECRETS")

# remove secret from the R Environment
rm(secret)
```

Right now we can check that secret with the name 'secret' is already in the Vault. You can even find dedicated folder there. This vault can be obviously be 'commit' ted to the Public Repository...

##### get secrets

Next I will demonstrate the ability to decrypt secret of the user 'vz' having the private key... 

```{r}
# decrypting secret from Vault (password from private key is asked in interactive mode)
get_secret("secret",
            key = file.path("/Volumes/PRIVATE/private.key"),
            vault = "COMMON_SECRETS")
```

##### update the secret

In the event of changing password I will now need to **update_secret()**. For example I will now change my file manually

```{r}
# updating the secret
library(tidyverse)
read_csv("passwords.csv") %>% 
add_row(USERNAME = "kmdl",
        EMAIL = "bcde@mail.com",
        PASSWORD = "ewds-9ksd-bndk",
        DESCRIPTION = "adding one more fake password") %>% 
write_csv("passwords.csv")
# view them
read_csv("passwords.csv")
```

Now we can update the 'secret' object in the vault

```{r}
# update object 'secret' in the vault
update_secret('secret', 
              read_csv("passwords.csv"),
              key = file.path("/Volumes/PRIVATE/private.key"),
              vault = "COMMON_SECRETS")
```

this way our secret was updated directy in the vault...

##### share secret

Objective of the lecture was to share secret. For that I will now add another user. This user named 'sam' has provided his public key...

```{r}
# sam.public.key is stored in the R Project file
add_user("sam", public_key = "sam.public.key",
         vault = "COMMON_SECRETS")
```

If I now check my vault I will see there file 'sam.pem' which is the public key of sam now copied to the vault.

It is possible to list users that are in the vault:

```{r}
list_users(vault = "COMMON_SECRETS")
```

and the secrets that are in the vault:
```{r}
list_secrets(vault = "COMMON_SECRETS")
```

at this moment sam can't access secret:

```{r}
# if sam is not listed in the users for this secret he can't access it...
secretbob <- get_secret("secret",
                     key = "sam.private.key",
                     vault = "COMMON_SECRETS")
```

in order to finally share the secret with 'sam' we need to **share_secret()**:

pay attention that private key used by second user 'vz' must be indicated...

```{r}
# share secret with 'sam
share_secret("secret", users = "sam",
             file.path("/Volumes/PRIVATE/private.key"),
             vault = "COMMON_SECRETS")
```


##### accessing secret by collaborator

Now 'sam' can det the secret:

```{r}
# secret read by sam
secretBob <- get_secret("secret",
                        key = "sam.private.key",
                        vault = "COMMON_SECRETS")
```


##### adding another secret to the vault

Now let's assume that I have a Database API key that I want to encrypt and share to both collaborators 'vz' and 'sam'... it will be necessary to use function **add_secret()**. We indicate name, string with your password and users. Folder indicating vault will follow as the last argument for this function:

```{r}
# adding api keys as a secret
add_secret(name = "api_key1",
           value = "q342sde099sdsdflfnaks972k2l",
           users = c("vz", "sam"),
           vault = "COMMON_SECRETS")
```

Once the changes are committed to the github repository it will become possible for both users to access this api key!!!

##### stop accessing the secret to specific user

Package secret also allowing to stop access to the vault with specific secret

```{r}
# unshare secret to bob
unshare_secret("secret", users = "sam", vault = "COMMON_SECRETS")
```

Sam will not be able to read this secret anylonger

```{r}
# trying to read secret with sam's private key
get_secret("secret", key = "sam.private.key", vault = "COMMON_SECRETS")
```

We can also delete user entirely if we want to

```{r}
# deletes the user
delete_user("sam", vault = "COMMON_SECRETS")
```


##### deleting secret that is not used anymore

To delete the secret, for example secret 'api_key1' we can intuitively use function **delete_secret()**

```{r}
# delete secret
delete_secret('api_key1', vault = "COMMON_SECRETS")
```

Entire folder with secret 'api_key1' will be deleted...

##### Conclusion

At this point we have covered the scenario of keeping shared information in the public repository. This is now possible to keep encrypted information in the vault, manage access to this informtion to several users who provided us their public keys...

I have provided an assignment for you to be able to go and practice using package secret.

I will be waiting you in the next lecture where we will talk about how to keep your encrypted secrets in your google drive folder!!!

Exercises:
1. Create a vault and name it "S.VAULT"
2. Generate Private keys for the 1 generic user 'user1' and use your own public key. You will be 'user0'
3. Add users to the vault
4. Add secret 'mtcars', encrypt entire dataset mtcars for that, make it available for both 'user0' and 'user1' users
5. Check that 'user1' can decrypt the secret 'mtcars'
6. Delete user 'user1' 
7. Try to decrypt 'mtcars' with private key from 'user1
8. Delete secret 'mtcars'
