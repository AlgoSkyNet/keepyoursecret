#### Lecture 16 Keep Common Secret in Public Version Control

Hello and welcome back to the course Keep Your secret under your control. In this lecture we will cover simple idea of keeping encrypted information in the Public Git Hub Repository. 

Our goal will be to see how to use package 'secret' in R to keep part of R project encrypted.

```{r}
library(secret)
```

// Authors: "Gábor Csárdi and Andrie de Vries".

Our scenario for this lecture will be to:

* create vault
* add users to the vault
* ...

A vault is a folder that will contain public keys of the users...

```{r}
# create vault
create_vault("COMMON_SECRETS")
```

Feel free to open folder...

Now we will add users to the vault. At first I will be using my public key stored in my USB key

```{r}
# adding user to the vault
add_user(email = "vz",
         public_key = file.path("/Volumes/PRIVATE/public.key"),
         vault = "COMMON_SECRETS")
```

The next step for me will be to add a secret to our vault. In this case I will use my csv file 'passwords.csv'. 

```{r}
# adding a secret
secret <- read_csv("passwords.csv")

add_secret(name = "secret", 
           value = secret,
           users = "vz",
           vault = "COMMON_SECRETS")

# remove secret from the R Environment
rm(secret)
```

Right now we can check that secret with the name 'secret' is already in the Vault. This vault can be obviously be 'commit' ted to the Public Repository...

Next I will demonstrate the ability to decrypt secret of the user 'vs' having the private key... 
```{r}
# decrypting secret from Vault (password from private key is asked in interactive mode)
secret <- get_secret("secret",
                     key = file.path("/Volumes/PRIVATE/private.key"),
                     vault = "COMMON_SECRETS")
```

Objective of the lecture was to share secret. For that I will now add another user. This user named 'sam' has provided his public key...

```{r}
# sam.public.key is stored in the R Project file
add_user("sam", public_key = "sam.public.key",
         vault = "COMMON_SECRETS")
```

If I now check my vault I will see there file 'sam.pem'.

It is possible to list users that are in the vault:

```{r}
list_users(vault = "COMMON_SECRETS")
```

and the secrets that are in the vault:
```{r}
list_secrets(vault = "COMMON_SECRETS")
```

at this moment sam can't access secret:

```{r}
secretbob <- get_secret("secret",
                     key = "sam.private.key",
                     vault = "COMMON_SECRETS")
```

I is necessary to delet and then share the secrets again:

```{r}
# delete secret
delete_secret("secret", vault = "COMMON_SECRETS")
# adding secret for both sam and vz
add_secret(name = "secret", 
           value = secret,
           users = c("vz","sam"),
           vault = "COMMON_SECRETS")
```

Now 'sam' can det the secret:

```{r}
# secret read by bob
secretBob <- get_secret("secret",
                        key = "sam.private.key",
                        vault = "COMMON_SECRETS")
```

Now let's assume that I have a Database API key that I want to encrypt!

```{r}
# adding api keys as a secret
add_secret(name = "api_key1",
           value = "q342sde099sdsdflfnaks972k2l",
           users = c("vz", "sam"),
           vault = "COMMON_SECRETS")
```

Once the changes are committed to the github repository it will become possible for both users to access this api key!!!

Package secret also allowing to stop access to the vault with specific secret

```{r}
# unshare secret to bob
unshare_secret("api_key1", users = "sam", vault = "COMMON_SECRETS")
```

Sam will not be able to read this secret anylonger

```{r}
# trying to read secret with sam's private key
get_secret("api_key1", key = "sam.private.key", vault = "COMMON_SECRETS")
```



Exercise:
1. Add secret 'mtcars', encrypt entire dataset mtcars for that, make it available for both 'vz' and 'sam' users
2. Check that user 'sam' can decrypt the secret
3. Delete user
