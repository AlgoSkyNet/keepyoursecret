#### Lecture 16 Keep Common Secret in Public Version Control

Hello and welcome back to the course Keep Your secret under your control. In this lecture we will cover simple idea of keeping encrypted information in the Public Git Hub Repository. 

Our goal will be to see how to use package 'secret' in R to keep part of R project encrypted.

```{r}
library(secret)
```

// Authors: "Gábor Csárdi and Andrie de Vries".

Our scenario for this lecture will be to:

* create vault
* add users to the vault
* ...

A vault is a folder that will contain public keys of the users...

```{r}
# create vault
create_vault("COMMON_SECRETS")
```

Feel free to open folder...

Now we will add users to the vault. At first I will be using my public key stored in my USB key

```{r}
# adding user to the vault
add_user(email = "vz",
         public_key = file.path("/Volumes/PRIVATE/public.key"),
         vault = "COMMON_SECRETS")
```

The next step for me will be to add a secret to our vault. In this case I will use my csv file 'passwords.csv'. 

```{r}
# adding a secret
secret <- read_csv("passwords.csv")

add_secret(name = "secret", 
           value = secret,
           users = "vz",
           vault = "COMMON_SECRETS")
```

I will then create one private and public keys for a fake user "sam"

```{r}
# create user private key and store it in the R project folder



```
