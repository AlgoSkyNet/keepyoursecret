This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

#### Getting started with R

Purpose of this lecture is to give a very basic `start up` into `R`


#### Verify Packages Installed and basic commands

```{r, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
######################## This is a comment
# Note that you can select the code and press CTRL + ENTER / CMD + ENTER (Mac)

# to install packages
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

```{r}
# to load packages
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
# to check packages loaded and write them to the vector
myPackagesLoaded <- search()
```

```{r}
# to visualize the vector
print(myPackagesLoaded)
```

```{r}
# or just with
myPackagesLoaded
```

```{r}
# dataframe is important data object in R. Different columns can have different data types (e.g. string, numeric, etc)
myDataFrame <- iris

# visualize 'head' or 'tail' of the object
head(myDataFrame, 4) # you can specify number of object to visualize
```

```{r}
# to delete objects from global environment
rm(myPackagesLoaded, myDataFrame)

# to see help page of the function
?rm

```

#### Concept of 'pipes'

Probably very powerful concept in R is to use 'pipe' or `%>%` construct. It is allowing you to pass the result of the function as a first argument of the following function:

```{r}
# extracting species column
species1 <- myDataFrame %>% select(Species)
```

is the same as to do:

```{r}
# without a 'pipe'
species2 <- select(myDataFrame, Species)
```

The result is the same

```{r}
# check if the objects are identical
identical(species1, species2)
```
