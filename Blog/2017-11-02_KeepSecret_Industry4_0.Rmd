## Why to bother?

Have your heard this term 'password chaos'? This is when you exposed to necessity to keep creating stronger passwords, not re-using them across resourses, replacing them every now and then and so on. The only solution seems to be using special programs to encrypt/decrypt your passwords. Of course there are programs designed to do this, but why not to use one extra program if you can do that all with R Statistical Software?

## Public Key Cryptography




```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
